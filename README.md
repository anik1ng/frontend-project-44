## Frontend JavaScript Project 44
This project is part of the [Hexlet.io](https://hexlet.io) JavaScript learning course.

"Mind Games" is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game poses questions that must be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and prompt you to play it again. The games include:

Calculator: Evaluating arithmetic expressions.
Progression: Finding missing numbers in a sequence.
Definition of an even number.
Determination of the greatest common divisor.
Definition of a prime number.

## Requirements
Node.js 12.x or higher
